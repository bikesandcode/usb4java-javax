usb4java-javax
==============

This is an extension to usb4java and implements javax-usb using the libusb
wrapper provided by usb4java as backend.

For more detailed information please visit the [usb4java website](http://usb4java.org/).

Forked only to provide access to a few internal methods and classes that 
were handy to have direct access to on a multi platform codebase.
